# Multicast examples 

This folder contains the Multicast examples of the ByteBlower GUI.
Doing multicasts test with the ByteBlower GUI is done easily configuring
it as a destination of a FrameBlasting flow.

## Note:
  The TCP protocol doesn't work over multicast. This is a fundemental
  problem. To make this clear, you won't be able to select Multicast
  destination as soon as you've selectec a TCP template in the flow
  view.

# IPv4_IGMP
In IPv4 multicast is orchestrated by the IGMP protocol. This example
shows how to set the the 3 versions fo this protocol.


# IPv6_MLD_
IPv6 uses the MLD protocol for multicast. You get the option for MLDv1
or MLDv2 as soon as you add an IPv6 port in the Multicast View.
