#  FrameBlasting examples

On this directory you'll find the FrameBlasting examples. To use them you'll need 
to redock the ports. 

## Intro: What is FrameBlasting?

FrameBlasting is one of the two traffic generation modes of the ByteBlower. The
basic use case is loading the network with UDP traffic.
