# Intro
This folder has a couple example tools on how to change ByteBlower GUI project
file without opening the GUI. These tools help you automating your test setup.

The tools are written in Python and use lxml for processing the ByteBlower projects.
They should work both in Python3 and Python 2.7

# Prerequisites

We use [lxml](https://lxml.de/) package for processing the ByteBlower projects. You can install this using following command

`pip install lxml`

Some of the scripts need the ByteBlower-API (mostly redocking). An installer is found on http://setup.byteblower.com
