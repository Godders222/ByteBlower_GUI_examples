# ByteBlower_GUI_examples

This github project collects examples for the ByteBlower GUI.

## Requirements:

* A ByteBlower GUI. The latest version is freely available at http://setup.byteblower.com/software.html This is sufficient to open the projects and inspect them.
* A ByteBlower Traffic generator if you want to run the projects. In the current set, any model will do. More information about the traffic generator can be found at http://www.byteblower.com


## Folders:

* frameblasting: stateless frameblasting. This is mostly UDP traffic, although we also show howto send out custom made packets.
* tcp: statefull tcp. These examples show howto load the network with TCP traffic. 
* basic_usecases: You'll find here a couple worked out use cases. These are useful to get started with actual testing. 
* multicast: Examples around multicast. Both IPv4 (IGMP) and IPv6 (MLD) are available.
* traffic profiles: In this folder you'll find realworld usecases implemented using the ByteBlower building blocks.
