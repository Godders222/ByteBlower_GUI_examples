# ByteBlower_GUI_examples

This github project collects examples for the ByteBlower GUI.

## Requirements:

* A ByteBlower GUI. The latest version is freely available at http://setup.byteblower.com/software.html This is sufficient to open the projects and inspect them.
* A ByteBlower Traffic generator if you want to run the projects. In the current set, any model will do.


## Folders:

* frameblasting: stateless frameblasting. This is mostly UDP traffic, although we also show howto send out custom made packets.
* tcp: statefull tcp. These examples show howto load the network with TCP traffic.
